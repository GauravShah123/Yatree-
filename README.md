# Yatree-Updated

#The app fulfills four different purposes namely- student, teacher, tourist and gamer. 
#The teacher dashboard allows for an organised way in which the teacher can track the 
#student’s progress, make a customized trivia quiz, and easily access to the custom 
#made quizzes through a teacher library section. When you sign in as a tourist, our 
#game will direct you to our "Live the Culture" page from where the tourist has various 
#options to explore, from our custom y-moji to even acquiring local recipes, folklore 
#and tales . The user can then also give their valuable feedback for us to continue 
#improving our game. When you sign-in as a Gamer, you will be directed to the “Custom 
#tour” page which will then take you to the Map of India. From here, the user will 
#choose his region and then be directed to the Gamer’s console which will provide the 
#user with a variety of adventure sports and other activities which are found in that 
#region in the form of games.
